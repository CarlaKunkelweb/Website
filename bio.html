    <div class="indent">
      When I am not seeing clients, my life is full of activities, for sport I enjoy cycling as much as I can, hiking and long walks with the dogs. Pilates is also a favorite strength and stretching workout I enjoy. Aside from being passionate about design and new trends and innovations , I do enjoy living life to the fullest. I have a daughter and 3 grand children who live on the beautiful island of Oahu whom I love spending time with. I am a dog person, a lover of dogs. I have 3 of my own and enjoy their company and antics.

    My goal is to ensure each client achieves their desired lifestyle look, be it Transitional, Traditional or Contemporary, thru a new home purchase, a remodel or just sprucing up. It is imperative each home is beautifully designed to achieve both aesthetic and function compatibility, adhering to a pre decided budget.
